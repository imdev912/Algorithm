# Leap Year and Leap Year Algorithm

## What is a Leap Year?

A leap year, also known as an intercalary year, is a year that contains an extra day, February 29th, to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year. This adjustment ensures that the calendar year closely matches the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

## Determining Leap Years

Leap years follow a specific rule to determine whether a year is a leap year or not. Here is a simple algorithm to check for leap years:

## Leap Year Algorithm

1. If a year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, it's not a leap year.
2. If a year is divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, it's a leap year.
3. If a year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year. Otherwise, it's not a leap year.

In summary, a leap year is:

- Divisible by 4
- Not divisible by 100, except:
- If it's divisible by 400
